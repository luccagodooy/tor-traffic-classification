# tor-traffic-classification
This repository contains the code and the datasets that I have used to train various ML models to classify Tor traffic.
My intent was to use network traffic information to differentiate between TOR and non-TOR traffic, as well as discovering what activities were being conduced while on Tor (such as VoIP, P2P, chatting, and so on).
This GitHub contains NO exploraroty data analysis. For that, please refer to my article on Medium: https://medium.com/@PrinceOfFools/using-machine-learning-techniques-to-characterize-tor-traffic-74aa79b260d0

The original dataset has been downloaded from the Canada Institute of Cybersecurity at https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/tor.html
